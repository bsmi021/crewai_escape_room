# CrewAI Escape Room Project Documentation

## 📁 Documents Created

I've created two comprehensive documents for your CrewAI Escape Room Simulation project:

### 1. **CrewAI_Escape_Room_Design_Document.md**
- Complete technical design document
- Simplified architecture based on CrewAI research
- Agent personalities and implementation details
- Room mechanics and game flow
- Iterative problem-solving implementation
- Code samples and technical specifications

### 2. **Comprehensive_Development_ToDo_List.md**
- 371+ specific, actionable development tasks
- Professional development standards (100% test coverage)
- Complete project lifecycle from setup to deployment
- Testing strategies and quality assurance procedures
- Scripts, troubleshooting, and documentation requirements

## 📂 File Locations

Both documents are saved in:
