# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical implementation gaps that prevent the CrewAI Escape Room Simulation from executing. The system currently has missing function implementations, incomplete class definitions, and configuration issues that cause runtime failures. These fixes are mandatory before any simulation runs can occur, as they resolve NameError and AttributeError exceptions that prevent basic functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all missing function implementations to be completed, so that the simulation can run without NameError exceptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the iterative engine calls `get_strategist_context_for_iteration` THEN the system SHALL return a formatted context string with iteration number, previous failures, and current resources
2. WHEN the iterative engine calls `get_mediator_context_for_iteration` THEN the system SHALL return a formatted context string with team dynamics, stress level, and relationship status
3. WHEN the iterative engine calls `get_survivor_context_for_iteration` THEN the system SHALL return a formatted context string with threat assessment, survival memory, and resource status
4. WHEN any context generation function is called with valid parameters THEN the system SHALL return a non-empty string within 1 second

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the RelationshipTracker class to be implemented, so that agent interactions can be monitored and trust levels maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a RelationshipTracker is instantiated THEN the system SHALL create an empty relationship tracking system
2. WHEN an interaction is recorded between two agents THEN the system SHALL update trust levels and interaction history
3. WHEN successful collaboration is recorded THEN the system SHALL increase trust levels between participating agents by 0.1
4. WHEN a conflict is recorded THEN the system SHALL decrease trust levels between agents by 0.05-0.1 based on resolution
5. WHEN team cohesion is calculated THEN the system SHALL return a value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing average trust levels
6. WHEN relationship summary is requested THEN the system SHALL return a readable string describing current relationship states

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SurvivalMemoryBank class to be implemented, so that the Survivor agent can learn from previous experiences and assess threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a SurvivalMemoryBank is instantiated THEN the system SHALL initialize with default survival principles
2. WHEN a close call is recorded THEN the system SHALL store the experience with high importance score (0.9)
3. WHEN a successful strategy is recorded THEN the system SHALL store the experience with moderate importance score (0.7)
4. WHEN threat assessment is requested THEN the system SHALL return severity, probability, and mitigation strategies based on past experiences
5. WHEN relevant experiences are requested THEN the system SHALL return up to 5 most important experiences as formatted text
6. WHEN survival probability is calculated THEN the system SHALL return a value between 0.1 and 0.9 based on historical success rates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dynamic API configuration for memory systems, so that the simulation works with available API providers (Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Gemini API key is available THEN the system SHALL configure memory to use Gemini with text-embedding-004
2. WHEN only OpenAI API key is available THEN the system SHALL configure memory to use OpenAI with text-embedding-3-small
3. WHEN only Anthropic API key is available THEN the system SHALL configure memory to use local sentence-transformers model
4. WHEN no API keys are available THEN the system SHALL raise a ValueError with clear error message
5. WHEN memory configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL successfully create CrewAI crew without configuration errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a simulation designer, I want the "only two can survive" constraint to be enforced, so that the core premise of difficult moral choices is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exit routes are defined THEN the main door SHALL have capacity of 2 agents maximum
2. WHEN exit routes are defined THEN the vent shaft SHALL have capacity of 1 agent maximum
3. WHEN survival scenarios are evaluated THEN the system SHALL generate all possible 2-agent survival combinations
4. WHEN escape probability is calculated THEN the system SHALL return 0.0 if agent count exceeds exit capacity
5. WHEN survival scenarios are evaluated THEN the system SHALL include moral difficulty scores for each sacrifice decision
6. WHEN survival scenarios are requested THEN the system SHALL return scenarios sorted by success probability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive safety measures implemented, so that the simulation cannot run indefinitely or get stuck in infinite loops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN simulation runs THEN the system SHALL enforce a maximum total time of 30 minutes
2. WHEN simulation shows no progress for 5 consecutive iterations THEN the system SHALL stop with stagnation reason
3. WHEN any exception occurs during simulation THEN the system SHALL catch the error and stop gracefully
4. WHEN progress hash is calculated THEN the system SHALL include iteration count, time remaining, solved puzzles, and discovered resources
5. WHEN stopping conditions are checked THEN the system SHALL return both stop decision and reason string
6. WHEN simulation completes or stops THEN the system SHALL generate a final report with termination reason

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling throughout the system, so that failures provide clear diagnostic information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN missing classes are instantiated THEN the system SHALL not raise AttributeError exceptions
2. WHEN missing functions are called THEN the system SHALL not raise NameError exceptions
3. WHEN invalid parameters are passed to functions THEN the system SHALL raise ValueError with descriptive messages
4. WHEN API configuration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which API keys are missing
5. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle exceptions gracefully and continue simulation where possible
