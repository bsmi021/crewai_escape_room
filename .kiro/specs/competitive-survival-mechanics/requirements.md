# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the current cooperative escape room simulation into a competitive survival scenario inspired by SAW movies, where three AI agents must compete for the single escape opportunity. The system should introduce randomization, scarcity, moral dilemmas, and competitive dynamics that prevent predictable cooperation patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Single Survivor Constraint

**User Story:** As a simulation observer, I want only one agent to be able to escape the room, so that the scenario creates genuine competition and survival pressure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation begins THEN the system SHALL establish that only one escape route exists
2. WHEN an agent attempts to escape THEN the system SHALL verify no other agent has already escaped
3. IF an agent successfully escapes THEN the system SHALL prevent all other agents from escaping
4. WHEN the simulation ends THEN the system SHALL record exactly zero or one survivor

### Requirement 2: Randomized Scenario Generation

**User Story:** As a simulation runner, I want each iteration to have different constraints and challenges, so that agents cannot rely on memorized solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a simulation starts THEN the system SHALL accept a random seed parameter
2. WHEN using the same seed THEN the system SHALL generate identical room configurations
3. WHEN using different seeds THEN the system SHALL generate different puzzle elements, resource distributions, and moral dilemmas
4. WHEN no seed is provided THEN the system SHALL generate a random seed automatically
5. WHEN generating scenarios THEN the system SHALL vary at least 3 major elements: puzzle type, resource scarcity level, and moral dilemma complexity

### Requirement 3: Resource Scarcity and Competition

**User Story:** As a simulation designer, I want limited resources that force agents to compete, so that cooperation becomes strategically risky.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the room is initialized THEN the system SHALL create scarce resources (tools, information, time)
2. WHEN an agent claims a resource THEN the system SHALL make it unavailable to other agents
3. WHEN multiple agents want the same resource THEN the system SHALL require them to negotiate or compete
4. WHEN resources are distributed THEN the system SHALL ensure no single agent has everything needed to escape alone
5. IF agents share resources THEN the system SHALL introduce risks or costs for cooperation

### Requirement 4: Moral Dilemmas and Betrayal Mechanics

**User Story:** As a scenario observer, I want agents to face moral choices that pit survival against ethics, so that different personality types respond differently under pressure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN presenting escape opportunities THEN the system SHALL include options that harm other agents
2. WHEN an agent chooses a selfish action THEN the system SHALL provide survival advantages but ethical costs
3. WHEN an agent chooses cooperation THEN the system SHALL create vulnerability to betrayal
4. WHEN agents make moral choices THEN the system SHALL track and influence their reputation with other agents
5. IF an agent betrays others THEN the system SHALL make future cooperation more difficult but individual success more likely

### Requirement 5: Dynamic Trust and Relationship System

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want agent relationships to evolve based on actions and betrayals, so that social dynamics influence survival strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents interact THEN the system SHALL track trust levels between each pair of agents
2. WHEN an agent betrays another THEN the system SHALL decrease trust and increase suspicion
3. WHEN an agent helps another THEN the system SHALL increase trust but also create dependency
4. WHEN making decisions THEN agents SHALL consider their relationship history with other agents
5. WHEN trust is low THEN agents SHALL be less likely to share information or resources

### Requirement 6: Information Asymmetry

**User Story:** As a simulation designer, I want each agent to have unique information, so that they must decide whether to share or hoard knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation begins THEN the system SHALL distribute different clues to each agent
2. WHEN an agent discovers information THEN the system SHALL make it exclusive to that agent initially
3. WHEN agents share information THEN the system SHALL track what each agent knows
4. WHEN making escape attempts THEN the system SHALL require agents to combine information or find alternative paths
5. IF an agent withholds critical information THEN other agents SHALL face increased difficulty

### Requirement 7: Time Pressure and Escalating Consequences

**User Story:** As a scenario controller, I want increasing pressure over time, so that agents must make increasingly desperate decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation starts THEN the system SHALL establish a time limit for escape
2. WHEN time passes THEN the system SHALL introduce escalating threats or consequences
3. WHEN agents delay decisions THEN the system SHALL reduce available options
4. WHEN time is running out THEN the system SHALL force agents into more desperate actions
5. IF time expires THEN the system SHALL ensure all agents fail to escape

### Requirement 8: Unpredictable Agent Behavior

**User Story:** As a researcher studying AI behavior, I want agents to exhibit different survival strategies based on their personalities and circumstances, so that no two simulations play out identically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN under pressure THEN the Strategist SHALL prioritize logical analysis but may become paralyzed by overthinking
2. WHEN facing betrayal THEN the Mediator SHALL attempt reconciliation but may become naive to manipulation
3. WHEN resources are scarce THEN the Survivor SHALL prioritize self-preservation but may alienate potential allies
4. WHEN moral dilemmas arise THEN each agent SHALL respond according to their core personality traits
5. WHEN previous strategies failed THEN agents SHALL adapt their approach but maintain personality consistency
