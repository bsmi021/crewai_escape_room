# Product Overview

## CrewAI Escape Room Simulation

A multi-agent AI collaboration system where three distinct AI personalities work together to solve escape room puzzles. The system demonstrates advanced AI agent coordination, memory-enabled learning, and iterative problem-solving.

### Core Concept
- **Three AI Agents**: Strategist (analytical), Mediator (diplomatic), Survivor (pragmatic)
- **Memory-Enhanced Learning**: Agents remember failed strategies and adapt across iterations
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Dynamic group decision-making with distinct personalities
- **Iterative Simulation**: Multiple rounds allow for complex puzzle-solving evolution

### Key Features
- Cross-iteration memory and learning
- Comprehensive analytics and progress tracking
- Real-time adaptation based on room constraints
- Detailed agent interaction logging
- Configurable simulation parameters

### Target Use Cases
- AI agent collaboration research
- Multi-agent system demonstrations
- Educational tool for AI coordination patterns
- Benchmarking agent learning capabilities

### Success Metrics
- Escape success rate across iterations
- Agent learning progression
- Team collaboration effectiveness
- Strategy adaptation quality
