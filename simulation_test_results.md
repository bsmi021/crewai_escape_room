## 🎯 **KEY FINDINGS**

### ✅ **1. Perfect Seed Reproducibility**
- **Tests 1 & 2**: Identical seeds (42) produced **IDENTICAL** results
- Same winner (mediator), same step count (3), same actions
- **Reproducibility Rate**: 100% ✅

### ✅ **2. Seed Differentiation Working**
Different seeds produce measurably different outcomes:
- Seed 42: mediator wins in 3 steps
- Seed 123: strategist wins in 5 steps  
- Seed 999: mediator wins in 7 steps
- Seed 960009: survivor wins in 1 step
- Seed 555: survivor wins in 2 steps

### ✅ **3. Winner Distribution**
All three agents capable of winning:
- **mediator**: 2 wins (Seeds 42, 999)
- **strategist**: 1 win (Seed 123)
- **survivor**: 2 wins (Seeds 960009, 555)

### ✅ **4. Variable Step Counts**
Different seeds produce different simulation lengths:
- Range: 1-7 steps
- Shows genuine competitive variation
- No fixed outcomes

### ✅ **5. Auto-Generated Seeds**
- Test 5 successfully generated random seed (960009)
- Produces valid, unique outcomes
- Seed properly logged and correlated
